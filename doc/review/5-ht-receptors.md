# 5-HT receptors

5-hydroxytryptamine receptors or 5-HT receptors, or serotonin receptors, are a group of G protein-coupled receptor and ligand-gated ion channels found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They mediate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The serotonin receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which acts as their natural ligand.

The serotonin receptors modulate the release of many neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, epinephrine / norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, as well as many hormones, including oxytocin, prolactin, vasopressin, cortisol, corticotropin, and substance P, among others. The serotonin receptors influence various biological and neurological processes such as aggression, anxiety, appetite, cognition, learning, memory, mood, nausea, sleep, and thermoregulation. The serotonin receptors are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical and recreational drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, anorectics, antiemetics, gastroprokinetic agents, antimigraine agents, hallucinogens, and entactogens.

| Family | Type | Mechanism | Potential |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 5-HT1 | Gi/Go-protein coupled | Decreasing cellular levels of cAMP | Inhibitory |
| 5-HT2 | Gq/G11-protein coupled | Increasing cellular levels of IP3 and DAG | Excitatory |
| 5-HT7 | Gs-protein coupled | Increasing cellular levels of cAMP | Excitatory

### 5-HT1A

5HT1A receptors are often found on the same neuron that is releasing serotonin (called autoreceptors).  The reason the serotonin releasing neuron has the receptor is because it acts as a negative feedback system.  When thereâ€™s too much serotonin in the gap between neurons, the releasing neuron needs to know so that it can stop releasing more serotonin.
5HT1A receptors are also found on the serotonin receiving neuron (called postsynaptic receptors), where serotonin acts as the key and the 5HT1A receptor acts as the lock.  These postsynaptic receptors and their activation cause a chain of events that lead to all the good stuff that serotonin does.

### 5-HT1B

Serotonin 5-HT1B receptors, previously known as 5-HT1D receptors, are primarily located in the basal ganglia, striatum, hippocampus and vascular smooth muscle. 5-HT1B receptors play a role in thermoregulation, respiration, appetite control, sexual behavior and aggression.

5-HT1B receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS with the highest concentrations found in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, striatum, and the hippocampus. The function of the 5-HT1B receptor differs depending upon its location. In the frontal cortex, it is believed to act as a postsynaptic receptor inhibiting the release of dopamine. In the basal ganglia and the striatum, evidence suggests 5-HT signaling acts on an autoreceptor, inhibiting the release of serotonin and decreasing glutamatergic transmission by reducing miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) frequency, respectively. In the hippocampus, a recent study has demonstrated that activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1B heteroreceptors produces a facilitation in excitatory synaptic transmission which is altered in depression. When the expression of 5-HT1B in human cortex was traced throughout life, significant changes during adolescence were observed, in a way that is strongly correlated with the expression of 5-HT1E.

Outside the brain, 5-HT1B receptor activation also has vascular effects, such as pulmonary vasoconstriction. Furthermore, blocking 5-HT1B receptor signalling increases the number of osteoblasts, bone mass, and the bone formation rate.

Knockout mice lacking the 5-HT1B gene have shown an increase in aggression and a higher preference for alcohol. Under basal conditions, knockout mice present with a "normal" phenotype and exhibit a sucrose preference (lack of sucrose preference is considered a measure of anhedonia). However, after undergoing chronic unpredictable stress treatment to induce a "depression-like" phenotype these animals do not benefit from administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs).

### 5-HT2A

The mammalian 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of the 5-HT2 receptor that belongs to the serotonin receptor family and is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). 5-HT is short for 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, which is serotonin. This is the main excitatory receptor subtype among the GPCRs for serotonin, although 5-HT2A may also have an inhibitory effect on certain areas such as the visual cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. This receptor was first noted for its importance as a target of serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Later it came back to prominence because it was also found to be mediating, at least partly, the action of many antipsychotic drugs, especially the atypical ones.

5-HT2A may be a necessary receptor for the spread of the human polyoma virus called the JC virus.

Downregulation of post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor is an adaptive process provoked by chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and classical antipsychotics. Suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more 5-HT2A receptors than normal patients. These findings suggest that post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of depression.

##### Physiological processes mediated by the receptor include:

- CNS: neuronal excitation (most likely responsible for the psychedelic effects associated with 5-HT2A receptor agonists such as LSD, DMT, etc.),[29] behavioural effects, learning, anxiety
- smooth muscle: contraction (in bronchi and gastrointestinal tract)
- vasoconstriction / vasodilation
- platelets: aggregation
- Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor with 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in several tissues including cardiovascular and gut. Other 5-HT2A agonists like LSD also have potent anti-inflammatory effects against TNF-alpha-induced inflammation
- Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor in hypothalamus causes increases in hormonal levels of oxytocin, prolactin, ACTH, corticosterone, and renin
- Role in memory and learning

### 5-HT2B

The 5-HT2 receptors (of which the 5-HT2B receptor is a subtype) mediate many of the central and peripheral physiologic functions of serotonin. Cardiovascular effects include contraction of blood vessels and shape changes in platelets; central nervous system effects include neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of some of the effects of hallucinogenic substituted amphetamines.

The 5-HT2B receptor subtype is involved in:

- CNS: presynaptic inhibition, behavioural effects
- Vascular: pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Cardiac: The 5-HT2B receptor regulates cardiac structure and functions as demonstrated by the abnormal cardiac development observed in 5-HT2B receptor null mice. The 5-HT2B receptor stimulation can also lead to pathological proliferation of cardiac valves fibroblasts, which with chronic overstimulation of 5-HT2B can lead to a severe valvulopathy. Moreover, 5-HT2B receptors were recently shown to be overexpressed in human failing heart and antagonists of 5-HT2B receptors were uncovered to prevent both angiotensin II or beta-adrenergic agonist-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mouse.
- Serotonin transporter: 5-HT2B receptors regulate serotonin release via the serotonin transporter, and are important both to normal physiological regulation of serotonin levels in blood plasma, and with the abnormal acute serotonin release produced by drugs such as MDMA. Surprisingly however 5-HT2B receptor activation appears to be protective against the development of serotonin syndrome following elevated extracellular serotonin levels, despite its role in modulating serotonin release.

### 5-HT7

The 5-HT7 receptors have been detected in the central nervous system (CNS) areas of the human brain, and more specifically in the regions known as thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus. According to a series of studies that have been carried out using animal models, the presence of the 5-HT7 receptors within those brain regions demonstrate their implication in higher brain functions such as cognition, learning capability, memory and perception. The receptors also play an important role in the circadian rhythm, our internal 24-hour clock that controls the sleep/ wake cycle, but also in mood regulation, pain transmission and control of body temperature. Interestingly, 5-HT7 receptors are also involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle cells of the circulatory system, the intestines and the reproductive system.

Taking into account the involvement of the 5-HT7 receptors in so many physiological processes it is not hard for one to see that the malfunction of those receptors could result in a series of health problems.
