# 5-HT receptors

5-hydroxytryptamine receptors or 5-HT receptors, or serotonin receptors, are a group of G protein-coupled receptor and ligand-gated ion channels found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They mediate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The serotonin receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which acts as their natural ligand.

The serotonin receptors modulate the release of many neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, epinephrine / norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, as well as many hormones, including oxytocin, prolactin, vasopressin, cortisol, corticotropin, and substance P, among others. The serotonin receptors influence various biological and neurological processes such as aggression, anxiety, appetite, cognition, learning, memory, mood, nausea, sleep, and thermoregulation. The serotonin receptors are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical and recreational drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, anorectics, antiemetics, gastroprokinetic agents, antimigraine agents, hallucinogens, and entactogens.

The serotonin receptors have been classified as 5-HT1A-F, 5-HT2A-C; 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7. Unlike the 5-HT3 receptor that is ionotropic, the remaining receptors are coupled to different G proteins. Given the diversity of 5-HT receptors, it has been difficult to define their precise role on brain development, either individually or in combination with other receptors. Nonetheless, immunohistochemical studies show that these receptors are expressed early during embryonic development and are dynamically regulated postnatally, suggesting a pivotal role during brain development.

### 5-HT1A

5HT1A receptors are often found on the same neuron that is releasing serotonin (called autoreceptors).  The reason the serotonin releasing neuron has the receptor is because it acts as a negative feedback system.  When there’s too much serotonin in the gap between neurons, the releasing neuron needs to know so that it can stop releasing more serotonin.
5HT1A receptors are also found on the serotonin receiving neuron (called postsynaptic receptors), where serotonin acts as the key and the 5HT1A receptor acts as the lock.  These postsynaptic receptors and their activation cause a chain of events that lead to all the good stuff that serotonin does.

*Figure 1. Modulation of Glutamate- and GABA-Mediated Transmission by 5-HT in the Cortex, Striatum, Hippocampus, and Amygdala*

The well-characterized 5-HT1A subtype is a G protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) that operates both pre- and postsynaptically (Figure 1). Somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors are predominantly located on the soma and dendrites of neurons in the raphe complex and its activation by 5-HT or 5-HT1A agonists induces hyperpolarization, decreases the firing rate of 5-HT neurons, and subsequently reduces the synthesis, turnover, and release of 5-HT from axon terminals in projection areas. Postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors are widely distributed in forebrain regions, notably in the cortex, hippocampus, septum, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Hippocampal heteroreceptors mediate neuronal inhibition by coupling to the G protein-gated inward rectifying potassium channel subunit-2 (GIRK2). The metabotropic and ion channel-regulating actions of the 5-HT1A receptor are implicated in learning and memory and in the pathophysiology and treatment response of a wide range of disorders characterized by cognitive and emotional dysregulation. Chronic stress mediated by glucocorticoids has been reported to result in downregulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus in animal models. In line with this notion, evidence is accumulating that functional variation in the 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A) is associated with personality traits of negative emotionality as well as the etiology of disorders of the anxiodepressive spectrum.

5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors can be expressed in both excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (Figure 1), which renders the net outcome of the neuromodulatory action of 5-HT on circuit activity dependent on multiple factors (e.g., local 5-HT concentration, receptor ratio and intracellular coupling). On glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, 5-HT1A receptors are distributed diffusely and at relatively high density over the perikaryon, dendrites, and synaptic spines, whereas 5-HT2A/2C receptors are localized to the proximal dendritic shafts of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, and more diffusely on synaptic spines, in close association with glutamate receptors. In addition, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors are found on terminals and perikarya of GABAergic interneurons, respectively. 5-HT1A activation decreases N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) through reduction of ERK1/2 activity, which leads to a decrease in microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) phosphorylation, MAP2-microtubule interaction and microtubule stability involved in clustering the NMDA receptor-2B subunit. In contrast, 5-HT2A/2C activation increases NMDA receptor-mediated currents by activating the ERK1/2 pathway via the β-arrestin/Src/dynamin cascade, thus counteracting the effects of 5-HT1A activation in decreasing NMDA receptor-mediated currents. Thus, 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A/2C-activated signaling pathways appear to converge at antagonistic actions on ERK1/2.

##### 5-HT1AR Activation Modulates Neuronal Excitability and Responsiveness to Neurotransmitters

In both neurons and brain tissue, few signal transduction cascades associated with the activity of the 5-HT receptors have been described. Serotonergic fibers spread diffusely in brain and often lack direct synaptic contacts; however the release of 5-HT may play an important role in the fine tuning of neuronal communication in the hippocampus. The activity of the 5-HT1AR allows a modulatory effect by changing neuronal firing. Electrophysiological studies have shown that stimulation of 5-HT1AR in serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei (autoreceptor) induces cell hyperpolarization and a reduction in 5-HT release. Furthermore, the activation of 5-HT1AR exerts hyperpolarizing effects in hippocampal neurons. Nonetheless, in ventral hippocampus, 5-HT1AR activity produces an indirect excitatory response through the inhibition of GABAergic interneuron activity induced by hyperpolarization.

On the other hand, glutamate receptor-mediated transmission between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons can be depressed by 5-HT1AR activity. The change in cell polarity mediated by 5-HT1AR occurs by activation of Gαi/o and subsequent release of the βγ complex, which triggers the gating of inward rectifying potassium channels (Figure 2). Interestingly, in contrast to the desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, the persistent activation of 5-HT1ARs coupled to GIRK in the hippocampus does not promote its internalization. According to this evidence, it seems that the desensitization of 5-HT1ARs depends on the cell type in which the receptors are expressed. Furthermore, it was described that 5-HT1AR might reduce excitatory transmission in rat CA1 hippocampal area by a putative presynaptic mechanism that reduces Ca2+ entry and glutamate release.

##### 5-HT1A Receptor Activation Mediates Opposing Effects on Adenylate Cyclase Activity in Non-Neuronal and Neuronal Cells

The use of transfection techniques of the human 5-HT1AR in different cell lines has allowed further insight about the association of this receptor with specific G protein transducers, and related signaling pathways. In the HEK293 cell line, the activation of 5-HT1AR activates Gαi/o, leading to a reduction in cAMP levels through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) type I (Figure 3). However, when HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the 5-HT1AR along with AC type II, the agonist (8OH-DPAT) increased cAMP levels, an effect mediated by the Gβγ complex, which stimulates enzyme activity. Similar effects were observed in co-transfection experiments with pituitary cell lines. Interestingly, co-transfection with AC type II and Gαi2, but not Gαi1, Gαi3, or Gαo, resulted in an agonist-independent increase in basal cAMP levels, suggesting that the Gαi2 isoform promotes constitutive activation of the receptor. In contrast, the presence of both Gαi2 and Gαi3 results in reduced cAMP levels, suggesting that the action of Gαi3 predominates over that of Gαi2 (Figure 3).

##### Mechanisms Underlying the Functional Interaction of 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R

5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs mediate opposing effects regarding the neuronal excitability. 5-HT1AR activation reduces the activity of adenyl cyclase, whereas 5-HT7R activation stimulates adenyl cyclase activity and thereby increases intracellular cAMP thereby increasing neuronal excitability. Accordingly, 5-HT7R stimulation in the hippocampus was found to activate pyramidal neurons, unlike 5-HT1AR activation which inhibited pyramidal neurons. Both 5-HTRs are expressed in glutamatergic hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Therefore, it is likely that 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R stimulation decreases and increases glutamate release in the hippocampus, respectively. In line with these results, 5-HT7R activation enhances the AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents on CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas 5-HT1AR activation inhibits the AMPA receptor-mediated transmission between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons in both pre- and postsynaptic sites. However, the 5-HT1AR-mediated inhibitory effect on glutamatergic neurotransmission was stronger than the 5-HT7R-mediated facilitatory effect. One explanation for the increased effectiveness of 5-HT1AR in controlling the input from the Schaffer collaterals may stem from the different localization of the two receptors on the CA1 pyramidal neurons: 5-HT7Rs are found on the cell bodies, whereas the 5-HT1ARs appear to be mainly localized on dendrites.

Differences in the expression of the receptors could also play an essential role in their distinct activation pattern from the endogenous 5-HT. The progressive reduction of post-synaptic 5-HT7R levels during postnatal development, together with the maintenance of the expression level of 5-HT1AR, could increase the ratio of membrane 5-HT1ARs over 5-HT7Rs. Consequently, a model has been proposed regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs. 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R form heterodimers both in vitro and in vivo. This heterodimerization plays a functional role by decreasing Gi protein coupling of the 5-HT1AR and by reducing the ability of 5-HT1AR to activate potassium channels, without affecting the Gs protein coupling of the 5-HT7R. The heterodimerization additionally contributes to the desensitization of the 5-HT1AR through facilitated internalization.

5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R are co-localized in the cell membrane of hippocampal neurons, where their heterodimerization induces an inhibitory effect on the 5-HT1AR-mediated activation of potassium channels in hippocampal neurons. As mentioned above the post-synaptic levels of 5-HT7R are lower compared to the expression levels of post-synaptic 5-HT1AR, whereas this is not the case for the pre-synaptic 5-HT7R. These regional differences in the 5-HT7R levels and therefore in the concentration of the heterodimers, can explain the preferential desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors by SSRIs and more generally the region- and cell- specific differences in the signaling pathway mediated by the 5-HT1AR activation. In summary, the above data suggest that the positive or negative consequences of a drug on emotional memory and cognition depend on the relative level of 5-HTR expression and, its efficacy in activating different receptors with their downstream signaling pathways.

### 5-HT1B

Serotonin 5-HT1B receptors, previously known as 5-HT1D receptors, are primarily located in the basal ganglia, striatum, hippocampus and vascular smooth muscle. 5-HT1B receptors play a role in thermoregulation, respiration, appetite control, sexual behavior and aggression.

5-HT1B receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS with the highest concentrations found in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, striatum, and the hippocampus. The function of the 5-HT1B receptor differs depending upon its location. In the frontal cortex, it is believed to act as a postsynaptic receptor inhibiting the release of dopamine. In the basal ganglia and the striatum, evidence suggests 5-HT signaling acts on an autoreceptor, inhibiting the release of serotonin and decreasing glutamatergic transmission by reducing miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) frequency, respectively. In the hippocampus, a recent study has demonstrated that activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1B heteroreceptors produces a facilitation in excitatory synaptic transmission which is altered in depression. When the expression of 5-HT1B in human cortex was traced throughout life, significant changes during adolescence were observed, in a way that is strongly correlated with the expression of 5-HT1E.

Outside the brain, 5-HT1B receptor activation also has vascular effects, such as pulmonary vasoconstriction. Furthermore, blocking 5-HT1B receptor signalling increases the number of osteoblasts, bone mass, and the bone formation rate.

Knockout mice lacking the 5-HT1B gene have shown an increase in aggression and a higher preference for alcohol. Under basal conditions, knockout mice present with a "normal" phenotype and exhibit a sucrose preference (lack of sucrose preference is considered a measure of anhedonia). However, after undergoing chronic unpredictable stress treatment to induce a "depression-like" phenotype these animals do not benefit from administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs).

### 5-HT2A

The mammalian 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of the 5-HT2 receptor that belongs to the serotonin receptor family and is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). 5-HT is short for 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, which is serotonin. This is the main excitatory receptor subtype among the GPCRs for serotonin, although 5-HT2A may also have an inhibitory effect on certain areas such as the visual cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. This receptor was first noted for its importance as a target of serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Later it came back to prominence because it was also found to be mediating, at least partly, the action of many antipsychotic drugs, especially the atypical ones.

5-HT2A may be a necessary receptor for the spread of the human polyoma virus called the JC virus.

Downregulation of post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor is an adaptive process provoked by chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and classical antipsychotics. Suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more 5-HT2A receptors than normal patients. These findings suggest that post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of depression.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor)

By associating with multiple GPCR interacting proteins, two metabotropic receptors, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, impact a wide range of signal transduction pathways. Both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor-agonist complexes activate phospholipase C (PLC). 5-HT2C is critically involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, since it initiates the phosphoinositol second messenger cascade by producing inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which ultimately leads to opening L-type Ca2+ channels following release of calcium stores. Moreover, the protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) binds to 5-HT2C, and disruption of 5-HT2C/PTEN complexes can alter neuronal activity. There is evidence that the 5-HT2C receptor also interacts with proteins containing PSD-95-disc large-zonula occludens (PDZ) domains, and association of 5-HT2C receptors with PDZ proteins affects both receptor desensitization and internalization, depending on the type of the PDZ protein associated with the receptor. The spatiotemporal diversity of these interactions highlights the wide range of 5-HT-mediated adaptive plasticity at the synaptic level.

##### Physiological processes mediated by the receptor include:

- CNS: neuronal excitation (most likely responsible for the psychedelic effects associated with 5-HT2A receptor agonists such as LSD, DMT, etc.), behavioural effects, learning, anxiety
- smooth muscle: contraction (in bronchi and gastrointestinal tract)
- vasoconstriction / vasodilation
- platelets: aggregation
- Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor with 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in several tissues including cardiovascular and gut. Other 5-HT2A agonists like LSD also have potent anti-inflammatory effects against TNF-alpha-induced inflammation
- Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor in hypothalamus causes increases in hormonal levels of oxytocin, prolactin, ACTH, corticosterone, and renin
- Role in memory and learning

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor)

##### Signaling

Activation of neuronal 5-HT2ARs can induce pleiotropic effects via G protein-dependent, ligand-dependent, and ligand-independent signaling pathways, including phospholipase signaling, ERK pathway, and tyrosine kinase pathway in neurons. In most circumstances, activation of 5-HT2ARs increases intracellular Ca2+ levels via Gαq-PLC-IP3 signaling. In PFC, activation of 5-HT2ARs suppresses membrane Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ currents via a Gαq-mediated PLCβ/IP3/calcineurin signaling pathway. 5-HT2AR activation also stimulates the Gα12/13-phospholipase A2 signal transduction pathway, which promotes arachidonic acid release.

Besides PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling, 5-HT2AR activation also induces ERK phosphorylation via diverse intracellular signaling mechanisms. Src and calmodulin promote 5-HT2AR-mediated phosphorylation of ERK. In the PC12 cell model system, ERK phosphorylation by 5-HT2AR may not depend on PLC/PKC signaling, and instead requires an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and the activation of CaM and Src. The ERK target RSK2 directly acts on the third intracellular (i3) loop of 5-HT2AR protein leading to direct phosphorylation of the i3 loop at the conserved residue Ser-314 to suppress 5-HT2AR signaling. In addition, RSK2 is required for tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, both of which have been demonstrated to attenuate 5-HT2AR functioning in primary cortical neurons.

Besides the G protein, 5-HT2ARs are also coupled to β-arrestin2. 5-HT binds 5-HT2AR to stimulate Akt phosphorylation via the β-arrestin2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Src/Akt cascade. Application of the 5-HT2AR agonist DOI to cultured cortical neurons induced phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) via Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RacGEF) kalirin-7. The 5-HT2AR also regulates the tyrosine kinase pathway activity. Excitation of neuronal 5-HT2ARs activates transglutaminase which leads to transamidation of Rac1, a small G protein, resulting in constitutive activation of Rac1. Chronic treatment with olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, causes the desensitization of 5-HT2AR signaling. In rat frontal cortex, stimulation of the JAK-STAT pathway desensitizes the 5-HT2AR-mediated PLC activation induced by olanzapine. Furthermore, constitutive activation of 5-HT2ARs induces Gq/11 phosphorylation and desensitization (uncoupling).

As indicated above, 5-HT2ARs are also expressed in microglia and mediate 5-HT-induced exosome release. Activation of 5-HT2AR increases intracellular Ca2+ via PLC signaling in astrocytes and Glu eﬄux from C6 glioma cells. Considering the diversity of signaling cascades that can be triggered by 5-HT2AR activation, it is perhaps not surprising that serotonergic activation of 5-HT2ARs can have diverse influences on neuronal responses and CNS functions.

### 5-HT2B

The 5-HT2 receptors (of which the 5-HT2B receptor is a subtype) mediate many of the central and peripheral physiologic functions of serotonin. Cardiovascular effects include contraction of blood vessels and shape changes in platelets; central nervous system effects include neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of some of the effects of hallucinogenic substituted amphetamines.

The 5-HT2B receptor subtype is involved in:

- CNS: presynaptic inhibition, behavioural effects
- Vascular: pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Cardiac: The 5-HT2B receptor regulates cardiac structure and functions as demonstrated by the abnormal cardiac development observed in 5-HT2B receptor null mice. The 5-HT2B receptor stimulation can also lead to pathological proliferation of cardiac valves fibroblasts, which with chronic overstimulation of 5-HT2B can lead to a severe valvulopathy. Moreover, 5-HT2B receptors were recently shown to be overexpressed in human failing heart and antagonists of 5-HT2B receptors were uncovered to prevent both angiotensin II or beta-adrenergic agonist-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mouse.
- Serotonin transporter: 5-HT2B receptors regulate serotonin release via the serotonin transporter, and are important both to normal physiological regulation of serotonin levels in blood plasma, and with the abnormal acute serotonin release produced by drugs such as MDMA. Surprisingly however 5-HT2B receptor activation appears to be protective against the development of serotonin syndrome following elevated extracellular serotonin levels, despite its role in modulating serotonin release.

### 5-HT7

The 5-HT7 receptors have been detected in the central nervous system (CNS) areas of the human brain, and more specifically in the regions known as thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus. According to a series of studies that have been carried out using animal models, the presence of the 5-HT7 receptors within those brain regions demonstrate their implication in higher brain functions such as cognition, learning capability, memory and perception. The receptors also play an important role in the circadian rhythm, our internal 24-hour clock that controls the sleep/ wake cycle, but also in mood regulation, pain transmission and control of body temperature. Interestingly, 5-HT7 receptors are also involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle cells of the circulatory system, the intestines and the reproductive system.

Taking into account the involvement of the 5-HT7 receptors in so many physiological processes it is not hard for one to see that the malfunction of those receptors could result in a series of health problems.
